- 👋 Hi, I’m @ShruCipher,decoding bugs by day, debugging life by night.
- 👀 I’m interested in  turning coffee into code and Stack Overflow into solutions.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to control my infinite while loops
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate projects where "Hello, World!" isn’t just an introduction but a lifestyle.
- 📫 How to reach me : Code a signal in binary and hope it reaches my Wi-Fi, or just DM me.
- 😄 Pronouns: Ctrl/Cmd
- ⚡ Fun fact: My code compiles... sometimes on the first try. (Okay, just once, but it still counts!)
